# hello-world
First repository for learning. 

I am a slow artist lady who's trying to learn on her own. 

First I would like to program aleatory change to my vectorial drawing of a swimmer.

Secondly I would like to fabric a series of lamps that turn on itself and project the shadow of a keyframe lazer cut of my swimmer. 

Third I would like to play with interactive video in real time. 

I think it is anough for now, maybe to much.
